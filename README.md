# Java MySQL Connection (JDBC)

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates how to connect a Java application to a MySQL database using JDBC.

## What I learned
- How JDBC works in Java
- Connecting Java to MySQL
- Writing basic SQL queries from Java, such as insertion, deletion and updating


## Technologies Used
- Java
- MySQL
- JDBC
- Eclipse IDE
- SQL connector

## How to Run
1. Install MySQL, create a database and create a table if required to test deletion process.
2. Head over to Eclipse IDE and perform the code to connect Eclipse IDE to My SQL.
3. Update database URL, username, and password in the code
4. Add MySQL JDBC driver (JAR file) to the project
5. Run the Java file from Eclipse
6. connection is established

## Notes
This project was created as part of my college coursework to understand database connectivity in Java.
